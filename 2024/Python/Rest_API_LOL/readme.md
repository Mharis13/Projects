# League of Legends Characters API

This project is a RESTful API designed to manage a collection of League of Legends characters. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on character data. The API is built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Uvicorn for asynchronous support and high performance.

## Features

- **Create Characters**: Add new League of Legends characters to the database.
- **Read Characters**: Retrieve information about existing characters.
- **Update Characters**: Modify details of existing characters.
- **Delete Characters**: Remove characters from the database.

## Technologies

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ that supports asynchronous request handling.
- **SQLAlchemy**: The Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database access.
- **Uvicorn**: A lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools.
